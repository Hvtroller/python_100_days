Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that allows you to structure your code around objects, which are instances of classes. Python is an object-oriented programming language that fully supports OOP concepts.

In Python, you can define classes to create your own custom data types. A class is like a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.

Here's an example of a simple class definition in Python:

```python
class Car:
		def __init__(self, make, model, year):
				self.make = make
				self.model = model
				self.year = year

		def start_engine(self):
				print("Engine started!")

		def stop_engine(self):
				print("Engine stopped!")
```

In this example, we define a Car class with three attributes (make, model, and year) and two methods (start_engine and stop_engine). The __init__ method is a special method called the constructor, which is executed when a new object is created from the class. It initializes the attributes of the object.

To create an instance of the Car class, we can simply call the class as if it were a function, passing the required arguments:

```python
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022)
```

Now, my_car is an object (instance) of the Car class. We can access its attributes and call its methods using dot notation:

```python
print(my_car.make)  # Output: Toyota
print(my_car.model)  # Output: Camry
print(my_car.year)  # Output: 2022

my_car.start_engine()  # Output: Engine started!
my_car.stop_engine()  # Output: Engine stopped!
```

OOP allows you to create reusable and modular code by organizing related data and behaviors into classes. It promotes code encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are powerful concepts for building complex software systems.
