A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It allows you to break down your code into smaller, more manageable pieces. Functions can take input parameters and return output values. To define a function in Python, you use the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. Here's an example:

```python
def greet(name):
  print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

In this example, the `greet` function takes a parameter `name` and prints a greeting message. You can call the function by passing an argument, such as `"Alice"`. The function then prints the greeting message with the provided name.
