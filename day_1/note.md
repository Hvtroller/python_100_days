## Day 1
To print to console text *Hello, World!*

```
print("Hello, World!")
```
In python, double qoute and single quote can mixed in a string 

```
print('I said "Hello, World!"')
```
Otherwise, we can use `\` character in a double quoted string to use double quote in the string

```
print("I said \"Hello, World!\"")
```
We can use `\n` inside a string to make a line break

```
print("Hello, World!\nHello, World!")
```
We can use `+` character to con cat string

```
print("Hello" + " Dong vu")
```
We can get input from user in console using `input` function

```
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?\n") + "!")
```
Có thể sử dụng `#` character for comment code

```
# This is a comment
```
We can assign a value to a variable using `=` character

```
name = input("What's your name? ")
```
