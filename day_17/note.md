To define a class in Python, you can use the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. Here's an example:

```python
class MyClass:
  # class attributes and methods go here
  pass
```

You can then add attributes and methods to the class using the appropriate syntax. Remember to indent the code within the class block.
