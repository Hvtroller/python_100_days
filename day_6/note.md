## Python function
To define and call a Python function, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. For example: `def my_function():`

2. Inside the parentheses, you can specify any parameters that the function should accept. Parameters are optional. For example: `def my_function(parameter1, parameter2):`

3. After the colon, indent the code block that makes up the function's body. This is where you write the code that will be executed when the function is called. For example:

```
def my_function():
  print("Hello, world!")
```

4. To call the function, simply write its name followed by parentheses. For example: `my_function()`

5. If your function accepts parameters, you can pass values to them when calling the function. For example: `my_function("Hello", "world")`

Remember to define your functions before calling them in your code.

## Python Indentation

In Python, indentation plays a crucial role in defining the structure and scope of code blocks. Here are some key points to remember about Python indentation:

- Python uses indentation, typically four spaces, to indicate the beginning and end of code blocks. This is different from other programming languages that use curly braces or keywords like `begin` and `end`.

- Indentation is used to group statements together and define the body of control structures like loops and conditional statements.

- Consistent indentation is important for readability and to ensure that the code executes as intended. Mixing tabs and spaces for indentation can lead to syntax errors.

- Indentation is not just a matter of style in Python; it is a requirement. Incorrect indentation can result in syntax errors or logical errors in your code.

- Python relies on indentation to determine the nesting level of code blocks. The level of indentation determines which statements are part of a particular block.

- It is common practice to use four spaces for each level of indentation. This is the recommended style in the Python community.

- Some text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) automatically handle indentation for you. They may convert tabs to spaces or enforce a specific indentation style.

Remember to pay attention to indentation in your Python code to ensure that it is correctly structured and easy to read.
